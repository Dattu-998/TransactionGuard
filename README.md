# TransactionGuard: Imbalanced Fraud Detection

## 1. Project Overview

**TransactionGuard** is an end-to-end machine learning system designed to detect potentially fraudulent financial transactions within highly imbalanced datasets. The system rigorously prevents data leakage, evaluates multiple classifiers based on Average Precision (PR-AUC), and sets classification thresholds driven by business costs. It includes an automated drift detection pipeline, and serves inferences via a fast, containerized API.

## 2. Problem Statement and Class Imbalance

Fraud detection problems are fundamentally characterized by extreme class imbalance. In this scenario, legitimate transactions overwhelmingly outnumber fraudulent ones (often by 99.8% to 0.2%). Models evaluated purely on overall accuracy can appear highly performant while failing to detect any actual fraud.

This project tackles this by:
* Using **Average Precision (PR-AUC)** as the primary selection metric.
* Employing stratified splitting to preserve class proportions across training, validation, and untouched test sets.
* Calculating class weights based solely on training data.
* Using a validation dataset to pick the decision threshold that minimizes business costs, rather than relying on a default 0.5 threshold.

## 6. Dataset Source and Setup

The project is configured to use the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset.

### Manual Download (Recommended)
1. Go to the dataset page above and download the archive.
2. Extract the `creditcard.csv` file.
3. Place `creditcard.csv` in `data/raw/creditcard.csv`.

### Using the CLI
If you have your `kaggle.json` configured in your environment:
```bash
python scripts/download_data.py
```

### Synthetic Demo Data
If the Kaggle dataset is unavailable, you can generate a synthetic substitute for smoke-testing:
```bash
make demo
```

## 7. Environment Setup

### Linux / macOS
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
make setup
```

### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## 8. Training Commands

The training pipeline loads data, validates it, splits it, runs feature engineering, trains three models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM), selects the optimal business threshold on validation data, logs to MLflow, and saves the best model artifacts.

```bash
make train
# Or manually: MLFLOW_ALLOW_FILE_STORE=true PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/train.py
```

## 9. Evaluation Commands

Evaluates the saved model artifact strictly on the held-out test partition.
```bash
make evaluate
# Or manually: PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/evaluate.py
```

## 10. Threshold Optimization and Cost Assumptions

Threshold selection does not default to 0.5. Instead, it minimizes a configurable cost function based on the validation set predictions:
* **False Negative Cost (`FN_COST`):** Default 1000.0 (High cost of missing fraud).
* **False Positive Cost (`FP_COST`):** Default 10.0 (Cost of investigating a legitimate user).

## 11. MLflow Startup and Inspection

Start the MLflow tracking UI to view experiments:
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file://$(pwd)/mlruns
```
Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 12. Drift-Report Generation

Compares current data distributions to reference data using the KS-test.
```bash
make drift
# Or manually: PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/generate_drift_report.py
```
Reports are output to `reports/drift_summary.json` and `reports/drift_features.csv`.

## 13. API Startup Commands

Run the FastAPI inference service locally:
```bash
make run-api
```
The API expects the model artifacts to be present in the `artifacts/` directory.

## 14. Docker Build and Run

To run the API reproducibly using Docker:
```bash
# Build
make docker-build
# Run
make docker-run
```
Alternatively, using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 15. Swagger Documentation

Once the API is running, the interactive Swagger documentation is available at:
`http://localhost:8000/docs`

*Note: The following metrics were collected on the synthetic demo dataset.*

| Metric                               | Result (Logistic Regression, Selected) |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------: |

*(Note: LightGBM achieved 0.9627 PR-AUC, Random Forest 1.0000 PR-AUC. Logistic Regression was selected as best based on the specific synthetic generation pattern.)*

## 19. Limitations and Responsible Use

* This is a demonstration project, **not a certified production banking system**.
* False positives inconvenience legitimate customers; real deployments require manual review pipelines.
* The explicit cost-matrix optimization utilizes illustrative defaults ($1000 per false negative, $10 per false positive). Real business costs vary wildly.
* Sensitive transaction data must not be logged unnecessarily in the API.

## 20. Troubleshooting

* **Model Loading Errors (API):** Ensure you have run `make train` successfully so that artifacts exist in `./artifacts`.
* **MLflow Errors:** If tracking fails, prefix commands with `MLFLOW_ALLOW_FILE_STORE=true`.
* **ModuleNotFoundError:** Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` includes `src` and you've installed with `pip install -e .[dev]`.

## 21. Reproducibility

To perfectly reproduce the data split and model behaviors, the `transactionguard.config` module uses `RANDOM_STATE = 42`. Ensure that dependencies in `requirements.txt` remain appropriately constrained.
